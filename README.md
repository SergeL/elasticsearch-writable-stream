# Usage

The records written to the stream has to have the following format:
```javascript
{
  index: 'name-of-index',
  type: 'recordType',
  id: 'recordId',
  body: {
    name: 'Foo Bar'
  }
}
```

The `highWaterMark` option set on the stream defines how many items
will be buffered before doing a bulk indexing operation. The stream
will also write all buffered items if its is closed, before emitting
the `finish` event.

## Logging

A [bunyan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bunyan),
[winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) or similar logger
instance that have methods like `debug`, `error` and `info` may be
sent in as `options.logger` to the constructor.

# Example

```javascript
var ElasticsearchBulkIndexStream = require('elasticsearch-bulk-index-stream');

var stream = new ElasticsearchBulkIndexStream(elasticsearchClient, { highWaterMark: 256 });

someInputStream.pipe(stream);
```

- [elasticsearch-streams](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elasticsearch-streams)

Elasticsearch readable and writable streams. The main difference
between the bulk writer in `elasticsearch-streams` and this library is
that this library requires the `index` and `type` of the data being
written to exist in the record instead of being set in a callback when
the records written.
